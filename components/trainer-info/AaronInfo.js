                Aaronâ€™s three main passions in life are fitness, music, and philosophy. He gained his passion for fitness
                because it saved his life. He combines a science-based approach as well as a no-excuses mindset to his
                training. In his spare time, he furthers his fitness education through experience, mentorship, and formal
                education so he will always be improving as he works with you!
            </p>
            
            <p className="max-w-prose">
                Aaron takes his time to listen and connect with each one of his clients. He is grateful to be able to share
                his knowledge and experience with others to help them achieve their goals. He understands everyone is
                unique and there is no one-size-fits-all approach to personal training. If you have no experience in the
                gym or you just need a little direction, Aaron knows how to get and keep you rolling.
