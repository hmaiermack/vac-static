                pick up the pace to increase our heart rates for 15 minutes, then switch to full body conditioning work using 
                weights, bands, and balls. Class ends with 10 minutes of stretches and deep breathing.

                Zumba is an hour of dynamic, dance-based movement set to a playlist of mixed tunes and intensity levels from start 
                to finish. Each class begins with a warm-up, followed by songs of varying styles and rhythms (each one with its own 
                routine), and ends with a cool-down and stretching. Dance experience is not necessary to participate. Our goal is simple: 
                We want you to move, to have a great time doing it, and to come back for more!

                Zumba Gold is a low-impact, simplified version of Zumba. It still follows the same format of dynamic, dance-based 
                movement set to a playlist of mixed tunes that each have their own choreography. It's a great lower-intensity dance 
                fitness option as well as an “on-ramp” if you’re new to Zumba classes. Like Zumba, dance experience is not required to 
                participate!

                <p className="max-w-prose text-gray-700 leading-relaxed ml-8">
                Tai Ji Quan Moving for Better Balance® (TJQMBB) is an evidence-based fall prevention program designed for older 
                adults. Developed by Fuzhong Li, Ph.D., Senior Scientist at the Oregon Research Institute, TJQMBB draws from traditional 
                martial arts-based movements, but applies movement in a therapeutic regimen of lessons aimed at improving balance. The 
                series begins with gentler exercises and progresses week-by-week to stronger practice. Please wear loose clothing and 
                flatter-soled shoes with closed heels. Refer to https://tjqmbb.org/  for program details.

                A blend of Hatha and Anusara Yoga styles and spirituality, allowing each student to practice in the way that their body 
                needs that day or skipping the pose if it’s painful. I focus on strength, flexibility and balance, which are all necessary 
                for aging bodies. I sequence the class so that students are feeling capable of holding a standing balance, for example, 
                by warming up specific muscles related to that pose. I use a theme in order to inspire my students, and try to call 
                them by their names to promote community.
